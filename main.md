## What Am I doing now ?

At the moment, I'm working with two professors, mainly with <a href="https://engineering.louisville.edu/faculty/campbell-bego/">Dr.Bego</a> and <a href="https://engineering.louisville.edu/faculty/sabur-h-baidya/">Dr.Baidya</a>. In my research with Dr.Bego I  co-authored a paper "Expertise and Trust in GenAI". I am also working with Dr.Baidya on Computer Vision algorithms, mainly for the use on drones.
